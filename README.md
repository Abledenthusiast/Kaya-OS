# Kaya-OS
An implementation of the Kaya operating system by Alex Fuerst and Aaron Pitman

Wrote a complete operating system from scratch. The final product, in addition to support a multitude of peripheral devices,
successfully ran eight concurrent processes, each running in their own virtual address space.
